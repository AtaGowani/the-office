Yeah, he told me this morning.  And, obviously he hopes he can count on your discretion."],
      ["Michael: I would have never called him that if I knew.  You don't... You don't call retarded people \"retards\".  It's bad taste.  You call your friends \"retards\" when they're acting retarded.  And I consider Oscar a friend."],

I have been calling people \"faggie\" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake.  If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know?  I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing.  Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.  And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.", "Oscar: That sounds like a great, wonderful idea, let's do that."],

We still had to pay for all the food.  So we froze it.  But I'm, I'm doing well.  I have my own apartment.  I'm taking art classes.  And I have lunch for the next five weeks."],
      ["Roy: After Pam dumped me, I um, I kinda stopped taking care of myself there, and uh, I hit bottom when uh, drunk driving arrest.  I've been working out and um, you know, I'm not gonna take her for granted.  I gotta win her back."],
      ["Stanley:  I got them a toaster.  They called off the wedding and gave the toaster back to me.  I tried to return the toaster to the store, and they said they no longer sold that kind of toaster.  So now my house has got two toasters."],

I watch, Queer as F***, so...", "Jan: That's not what it's called.", "Toby: OK, Michael, are you aware that you ousted Oscar today?", "Michael: What?  What does that even...", "Jan: Coming out, is a significant moment for a gay person, and they should be allowed to select the timing and manner of announcing it.", "Michael:  Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade?  It's not like gay... shame festival.", "Toby: All right, now Oscar's feeling discriminated against by his co-workers, primarily Angela, and um, that's your fault.", "Michael: I think Angela might be gay.  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair?  Maybe!

Do you understand?"],
      ["Michael: The company has made it my responsibility today to put an end to 100,000 years of being weirded out by gays."],
      ["Oscar: Am I the first gay man you ever knew?", "Michael:  Trick question!  Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know.  Is that the right answer?"],

      ["Michael:  We're all homos!  Homosapiens.  Gays aren't necessarily who you think they are, people.  I mean anybody could be gay.  Business-men.  Like antique dealers, or hairdressers, or... accountants.  Oscar, why don't you take this opportunity to officially come out, to everybody here.  However you want to do it.  Go ahead.  Stand up.  I'm doing this for you.", "Oscar:  Yes I'm gay.  And I didn't plan on sharing that part of my life with you today, so, whatever.  Can I sit down now?"],
      ["Creed:: I'm not offended by homosexuality.  In the sixties I made love to many many women, often outdoors, in the mud and the rain.  And it was possible a man slipped in, and there would be no way of knowing."],
      ["Michael:  Who should be the judges and juries of our society?", "Angela: Judges and juries!", "Michael:  Yes, that's a good point.  She has a good point.  Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law.  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.  You know?  Sounds pretty good, right?", "Kevin:: That sounds great."],

She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!", "Phyllis:  I'm getting married to Bob Vance.", "Michael:  That's great.  Congratulations Phyllis.  That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!  [laughs] See?  Everybody has a chance!"],

I am coming out hetero!", "Oscar:  I think the problem with this office is that you are sending mixed signals about my being here.", "Michael: No no no.  The only signal that I am sending is:  Gay, good."],
      ["Michael:  Look, if I was gay, I would be the most flamboyant gay you have ever seen.  I would be leading the parade covered in feathers, and just... I would be waving that rainbow flag.", "Oscar:  I don't think I can work here any longer.  This has been the worst, most backwards day of my life.", "Michael:  You misunderstand-- OK.  You know what, OK.  I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is.  You ready?  I am going to embrace Oscar.  You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything.  Here we go.  We are going to make a statement.  You and I are going to make a statement together.  Oscar is my friend ---", "Oscar: I would rather not.", "Michael: ...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!"],
      ["Oscar: No, NO!  I don't want to touch you, ever consider that?  You're ignorant, and insulting, and small!", "Michael: All right, um... sorry.", "Oscar:  Michael... I'm sorry.  That was a good idea.  Come on, come on. [Oscar and Michael hug]", "Michael: [sobbing] I'm sorry I called you faggie.  You're not faggie.  You're a a good guy."],

Because this is an image that I want you people to remember for a long time to come.  Whenever you come into the office I want you to think about this.  [awkwardly kissing Oscar]  I did it.  See.  I'm still here.  We're all still here. [everyone claps]", "Michael:  [Dwight gets up to kiss Oscar]  Oh come on!  Dwight!  Come on, man!"],
      ["Michael:  We are not in the playground anymore.  There are new rules.  We have to be mature.  But we can't lose the spirit of child like wonder.  What is love...  anyway?  Maybe it's supposed to break all the rules.  Like me and Jan.  Or Oscar... and some guy.  Life is short.  When two people find each other, what should stand in their way?"],
      ["Michael:  I am glad that today spurred social change.  That's part of my job as regional manager.  But you know what?  Even if it didn't, at least we put this matter to bed.  ...that's what she said.  Or he said."],
      ["Michael:  Oh, there's Gill.  Oscar's roommate.  I wonder if he knows?"],
      ["Oscar:  I was going to quit.  But Jan offered me a three month paid vacation and a company car.  All I had to do was sign something saying I won't sue.  Gill and I are going to Europe.  Kids, sometimes it pays to be gay."],

      ["Jan: [on speakerphone] Okay, what is your goal for after lunch?", "Michael: I will do my job to the best of my abilities.", "Jan: [under breath] Heaven help us. [aloud] Specifically.", "Michael: I will do my regional manager job to the best of my capability.", "Jan: Specifically, Michael.", "Michael: Specifically, Jan, I will make at least ten phone calls to clients."],
      ["Michael: Yes, I have to begin every day by letting Jan know what I intend to accomplish, and then I have to call her at the end of the day to tell her what I did accomplish. But it's not mandatory. It's something that I... wanted to do... and so it's voluntary, really. Even though she... makes me. I think she just wants to hear my voice. Because we're no longer lovers, and she's just hurting. But things are going well with Carol. I've seen her seven times in the last few months, and I'm growing very fond of her kids. Tommy, who I call Tomas, and the little girl..."],

So give yourselves a round of applause.", "Oscar: I wonder how many phone calls you're missing while you're teaching us to answer phone calls.", "Kelly: The annex rocks.

Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning.

Won't that interfere with your other task forces?", "Dwight: Answer: No, because this is being given priority one. This is a petition for the business park to upgrade their security cameras as well as install two floodlights in the parking lot. And I know... I know what you're thinking. [Pam nods] Won't that just shed more light on the penises? But that is a risk we have to take. Pam. You can draw, kind of.

[camera pans over to Angela]", "Michael: OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick?

I encourage that.", "Karen: Look, it's really simple. We just want you guys to treat us with respect.", "Michael: See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?", "Dwight: Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?", "Michael: No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation.", "Jim: Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?", "Michael: Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?", "Dwight: [eating banana] Mm, less than three.", "Michael: That is not current.", "Dwight: You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.", "Jim: Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.", "Dwight: Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.", "Michael: You know what?

Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.", "Dwight: Alien. Blagh!", "Michael: What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not. [points to Pam] Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.", "Andy: If it were up to me, you ladies would be the fashion models.", "Kevin: Yes, Andy. Then the fashion models could come here and work with me.", "Karen: What you're saying is extremely misogynistic.", "Michael: Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.", "Karen: I'm saying that you're being sexist.", "Michael: No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.", "Karen: That - it's the same thing.", "Phyllis: Michael.", "Michael: Yes.", "Phyllis: When I got my hair cut short, you asked me if I was a lesbian.", "Michael: Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.", "Angela: And when we get mad, you always ask us if we're on our periods.", "Michael: I have to know whether you're serious or not.", "Dwight: I wish I could menstruate."],

It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall. [Kelly gasps]"],

I've seen a bathroom before.", "Kevin: Yeah, but... it's every guy's fantasy.", "Jim: I think you mean a girl's locker room. And in the fantasy, there's usually girls in it.", "Kevin: [quietly] Yeah. I'm going in.", "Jim: Go crazy.", "Kevin: [in women's bathroom] Oh... my... God."],
      ["Andy: I really appreciate your letting me work alongside you so closely today.", "Dwight: Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.", "Andy: This guy looks like a real deviant.", "Dwight: No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.", "Andy: Aye, aye, Cap'n.", "Dwight: More like, \"Aye, aye, General.\""],

I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.", "Ryan: I figured. It's cool.

I have a roommate, uh, Vijay Chokalingham, he's a sophomore at Queens College.  He actually works in the Indian restaurant right below the apartment, so... free food, and the place always smells like curry.  So, win/win. "]
