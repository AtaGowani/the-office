## Script Generator
This application will randomly select up to 5 lines of script from The Office and display it to you. It will list the season and the episode that the script was taken from.

## Why?!
WHY NOT.

## My Motivation
I LOVE The Office. I often find myself watching it when I am stressed or taking a study break, but that usually leads to me being super unproductive as I get distracted and binge watch episodes after episodes. This is a fun way for me to read snippets of the script during my study breaks while mentally picturing how it plays out...since I have the whole show memorized...ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ
